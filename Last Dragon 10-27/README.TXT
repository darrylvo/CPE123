USER INSTRUCTIONS:
	The Last Dragon is a platform shooter that utilizes the WASD keys, the spacebar, and the mouse to play. The purpose of the game is to avenge your kin by 
killing the King of Kanadia who has executed all the dragons of the land. In this milestone, we have implemented 3 total stages for the player to go through, as well 
as some cut scenes. There is a score, timer, and leaderboard that we’ve implemented, which allows the player to feel a sense of competitiveness towards other 
players. The first stage is the dragon forest, where we’ve created a tutorial- like feel so that the player can learn the controls easier. The second stage is 
significantly harder than the first. Also, after the first stage is beaten, the dragon changes to a larger one so that it shows that you have powered up. This gives
 variety in our game in that there is an evolving system. The second stage is the plains of Kanadia leading up to the castle. The third stage is the final stage that is 
where you infiltrate the kingdom.
